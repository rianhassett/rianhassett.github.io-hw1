            Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. It was created by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and is now maintained by Oracle. Java uses a virtual machine (JVM) to execute code, making it platform-independent.

            <strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Variables are containers for storing data values. Data types include primitives (int, double, boolean) and objects. Control flow structures include if/else statements, loops (for, while), and switch statements. Functions (methods) are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

            <strong>Getting Started:</strong> You'll need the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. A simple program begins with a class definition and a main method: public static void main(String[] args). Variables must be declared with their type before use.
